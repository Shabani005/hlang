## Simple programming language VM implemented in C. (look at examples folder) 

# Briefing
- Language is still in development with cooler features slowly coming, like compiling bytecode into a native executable by shipping the entire VM interpreter and bytecode inside the executable.

Usage:
```
cc -o builder builder.c
./builder <source file>
```
